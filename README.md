# sdk

___________________________________________
a clean sdk to start writing a cheat on
for csgo. this has everything you need for
a fully featured internal cheat.

___________________________________________
many of my close friends may know this as ayysense.
this was the initial sdk, without the menu, aimbot, esp, and everything else
that ayysense had.

credits to wzn, rifk/czapek, duxe.

apologies to rifk/czapek; i know that you didnt want this public, but at this point 
i know you don't care about it, and you no longer work on it. this is without the menu
that ayysense had, so it shouldn't be a big deal.
